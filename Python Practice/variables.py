#The equal symbol is the assignment
#operator in python

#To create a variable you must assign
#the name to a value
#Example:
#name = 'Diego'

#Rules:
#You can not use python keywords as 
#variable names

first_name = "Diego"  # or any name you like
last_name = "Garcia"  # or any surname you like

print(f"My name is {first_name} {last_name}.")
